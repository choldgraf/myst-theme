# Jupyter and Notebooks

MyST themes provide rich support for rendering Jupyter notebooks and computational content. This section demonstrates various features for working with notebooks, including controlling cell visibility and displaying computational outputs.

## Features

MyST supports:

- **Executable code cells** - Run Python, R, Julia, and other kernels
- **Cell tags** - Control visibility and behavior of cells and outputs
- **Rich outputs** - Display plots, tables, interactive visualizations, and more
- **Interactive features** - Support for widgets, Thebe live code, and more
